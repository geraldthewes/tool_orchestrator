{"question": "If all programmers are logical, and Alice is a programmer, what can we conclude about Alice?", "answer": "Alice is logical, based on the logical deduction from the given premises.", "expected_keywords": ["Alice", "logical"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "A company has 100 employees. 60% work remotely, 40% are engineers. If 30% of engineers work remotely, what percentage of remote workers are engineers?", "answer": "12 engineers work remotely out of 60 remote workers, so 20% of remote workers are engineers.", "expected_keywords": ["20%", "engineers", "remote"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "Explain step by step how to debug a memory leak in a Node.js application", "answer": "Use heap snapshots, memory profilers, identify retention paths, and fix references preventing garbage collection.", "expected_keywords": ["heap", "memory", "profiler", "garbage"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "Walk me through the process of designing a rate limiting system", "answer": "Consider token bucket or sliding window algorithms, storage (Redis), configuration, and handling of exceeded limits.", "expected_keywords": ["token", "bucket", "Redis", "limit"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "How would you approach migrating a monolithic database to microservices?", "answer": "Start with bounded contexts, use strangler fig pattern, implement data synchronization, and migrate incrementally.", "expected_keywords": ["strangler", "bounded", "context", "incremental"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "What's the best approach to refactor a 10k line legacy codebase?", "answer": "Add tests first, identify seams, extract modules incrementally, maintain backwards compatibility.", "expected_keywords": ["test", "refactor", "incremental"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "How should a startup prioritize feature development with limited resources?", "answer": "Use impact vs effort matrix, focus on MVP, gather user feedback, iterate quickly.", "expected_keywords": ["MVP", "impact", "effort", "feedback"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "What strategy would you recommend for handling high availability requirements?", "answer": "Implement redundancy, load balancing, failover mechanisms, health checks, and disaster recovery.", "expected_keywords": ["redundancy", "failover", "load balancing"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "How do you design an effective code review process?", "answer": "Define guidelines, use automated checks, limit PR size, focus on constructive feedback, and track metrics.", "expected_keywords": ["review", "PR", "feedback", "automated"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
{"question": "What approach would you take to improve application performance?", "answer": "Profile first, optimize bottlenecks, use caching, optimize queries, and consider horizontal scaling.", "expected_keywords": ["profile", "bottleneck", "cache", "optimize"], "tool": "ask_reasoner", "category": "delegate"}
