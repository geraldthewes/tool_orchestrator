{"question": "Determine 3^20 and discuss whether the result fits within a signed 32\u2011bit integer range.", "answer": "3^20 = 3,486,784,401. This exceeds the maximum value for a signed 32\u2011bit integer (2,147,483,647), so storing it in a 32\u2011bit signed variable would cause overflow; a 64\u2011bit integer is required.", "expected_keywords": ["3486784401", "32-bit", "overflow", "64-bit"], "tool": "calculate", "category": "multi_tool"}

{"question": "Calculate the binomial coefficient C(30, 12) and discuss its role in probability theory.", "answer": "C(30, 12) = 30! / (12!\u202f\u00d7\u202f18!) = 86,493,225.

{"question": "Write a function to compute n! (factorial) and explain whether a recursive or an iterative implementation is more efficient.", "answer": "An iterative loop (e.g., for i in range(2, n+1): result *= i) runs in O(n) time with O(1) extra space, while a na\u00efve recursive version adds O(n) call\u2011stack overhead. Therefore the iterative version is generally more efficient.", "expected_keywords": ["factorial", "recursive", "iterative", "efficiency"], "tool": "calculate", "category": "multi_tool"}
{"question": "Create a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year and describe the algorithmic complexity of the solution.", "answer": "A leap year is divisible by 4, except years divisible by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

{"question": "Implement a routine to return the nth Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation and compare its efficiency to the na\u00efve recursive approach.", "answer": "Matrix exponentiation computes the nth Fibonacci in O(log n) time by repeatedly squaring the transformation matrix [[1,1],[1,0]]. The na\u00efve recursive method requires O(2^n) time because it repeats sub\u2011problems.

{"question": "Implement a circular buffer with a fixed capacity of 10 elements and calculate how many items remain in the buffer after enqueuing 7 items and then dequeuing 3 items.", "answer": "The circular buffer can be implemented with an array of size 10, a head index, a tail index, and a count of current elements.
